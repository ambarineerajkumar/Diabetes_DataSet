 # Summary
 
The dataset consists of medical variables related to diabetes prediction. It includes eight input features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI (Body Mass Index), Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. The Outcome variable indicates whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0). The dataset helps in analyzing the factors contributing to diabetes. High glucose levels, BMI, and insulin resistance are strong indicators. Older individuals and those with a family history of diabetes also have a higher risk. The dataset can be used for predictive modeling and medical research to improve diabetes diagnosis and prevention.
